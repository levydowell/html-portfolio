<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Levy Dowell, an aspiring software engineer! I enjoy building tools that are helpful to myself and other people!
</p>

<p>One of my passionate hobbies is learning Japanese. I have been learning Japanese for about 3 years off and on, and 
  want to build tools/applications that will help language learners around the world. Stephen Krashen is one of my 
  favorite linguists. You can read more about him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen">here</a>.
